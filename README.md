# Stanford-Open-Policing-Project
I will use Python for data cleaning and visualization to gain insights from this dataset. The [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/) collects and standardizes data on vehicle and pedestrian stops from law enforcement departments across the United States.  They have gathered over 200 million records from dozens of state and local police departments across the country.  In this project, we will examine a subset of the data from the state of Rhode Island, which is the smallest US state in size.
